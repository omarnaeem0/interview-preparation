## Pass by reference, Pass by value

### pass by reference 
* basically pass the address `reference` of the entity such as a function as an argument to the function being invoked.
* altering the value inside that function changes the original value.

### pass by value
* passing an argument by value into the function will not change its value outside the function.
* it copies the value into two different locations in memory hence treating them as entirely separate entities.
